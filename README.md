# FastAPI Tutorial

In this repo I worked through the FastAPI tutorial to learn more about the framework. There is also an advanced tutorial with more information available.

## General Commands

There is a Makefile with the following commands for convenience.

To start the app you can run:

```
python3 -m uvicorn src.main:app --reload
```

### Unit Testing

To run the unit tests you can run: 

```
python3 -m pytest -v -s
```

## API URL

## Notes

FastAPI is a class that inherits directly from Starlette. Starlette is a lightweight ASGI framework. ASGI stands for Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface which is a spiritual successor to WSGI which provided a synchronous interface.

## JWT - JSON Web Token

It is not encrypted, so, anyone could recover the information from the contents. See [https://jwt.io/](https://jwt.io/).

But it's signed. So, when you receive a token that you emitted, you can verify that you actually emitted it.

### Auth Example

In our example John Doe's password is `secret`.
